```

## first thing first
tty
```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
```
find id_rsa
```
/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa user@ip
```
if they don't have id_rsa, generate by yourself and upload id_rsa.pub to authorized_key file
```
ssh-keygen
```

## basic enum
```
uname -a
~/.bash_history
~/.bash_profile
~/.bashrc
sudo -V
sudo -l
```

## /etc - nerve center of linux
```
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/hosts
```

## interesting files
```
find -type f
find -type f -name flag
```
looking for .log .conf .bak

## SUID - a type of permission that allows users to execute a file with the other's permission
```
